            <p>
              The idea for Voice of Gaza was born from a desire to amplify
              unheard voices in a region often overlooked by mainstream media.
              As developers and storytellers from Gaza, we recognized the urgent
              need for a platform where people could share their experiences,
              insights, and dreams freely and securely.
            </p>
            <p>
              This project began as a simple blog app, but quickly evolved into
              a mission: to preserve and promote authentic Gazan narratives
              through technology. Built using the MERN stack, Voice of Gaza
              empowers users to publish posts, engage in discussions, and
              explore categorized contentâ€”all in an intuitive, user-friendly
              environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, Voice of Gaza stands not just as a technical achievement,
              but as a symbol of resilience, expression, and digital freedom.
